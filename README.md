# Beyond-GenAI

## Purpose

Given the immense diversity of documents indexed in GenAi “clouds” (texts, images, etc.), can they be used as quantitative instruments for processing knowledge?

GenAI engines (e.g. Gemini-Google) offer exploration and integration processing tools, but documentation on the content of the “clouds” and the capabilities of their engines is almost absent. In such a case,
all that remains is to discover these processing capabilities by experimentation.

This repository contains demonstrative examples along with comments on the capabilities and limits of quantitative processing using GenAI tools
